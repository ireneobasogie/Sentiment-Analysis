    Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach 
    to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone 
    behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine 
    and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea.
    Streamlit is an open-source app framework built specifically for
    Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

    ### There are two functions in our project?
    - **Sentiment Analysis**: where you can enter a movie review, 
    and you'll get a sentiment among 'happy', 'not-relevant', 'angry', 'disgust', 'sad', 'surprise'
    - **Data Visualization**: where you can load the movie review dataset that we used for training our model
    and see the distribution graph of all sentiment labels
