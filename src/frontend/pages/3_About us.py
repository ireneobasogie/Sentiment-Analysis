    one of \
    we choose the task 'sentiment analysis of movie reviews'. The project will require students to \
        gather a dataset of movie reviews and their associated sentiments (positive, negative, or \
        neutral) and then preprocess the data to feed it into the Bert model. The Bert model \
        will be fine-tuned on the dataset and evaluated using various metrics such as \
        accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, the model's performance \
        will be visualized through confusion matrices and ROC curves. The project \
        aims to give students an understanding of how Deep Learning models can \
        be used for Natural Language Processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. \
        By the end of the project, students will have developed skills in data preprocessing, \
        model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation using the Bert model.")
